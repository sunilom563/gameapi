                    The Bath School disaster was a series of violent attacks perpetrated by Andrew Kehoe in Bath Township, Michigan. 
                    The attacks killed 38 elementary schoolchildren and 6 adults, and injured at least 58 other people. 
                    On the morning of May 18, 1927 – having previously murdered his wife at their farm – Kehoe set off almost simultaneous explosions at his home and at the Bath Consolidated School (pictured).
                     His devices destroyed the farm's buildings and ripped through the north wing of the school
